            <p>Prop vs State</p>
            <p>Ans:In JavaScript, props and state are both used to store data in a component. But, they are used for different purposes.
                Props are used to pass data from one component to another. They are read-only and cannot be modified by the child
                component.
                State is a local data storage that is local to the component only and cannot be passed to other components.
                The this.setState property is used to update the state values in the component</p>
            <p>How does useState work?</p>
            <p>It is call the hook in the React , It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to
                update it. The Hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an updated state value whenever
                the setter function is called</p>
            <p>Purpose of useEffect other than fetching data in React</p>
            <p>It allows to make effect on the component. Other than fetching data is helps to directly update the DOM and update
                the timer.
            </p>
            <p>How does react works</p>
            <p>React works by creating a virtual DOM in memory instead of manipulating the browserâ€™s DOM directly. React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
                This makes React very fast and efficien</p>
