It is a project for the summer camp organization and it is build on MERN stack.  I have implemented home page, login, registration, Instructors page, classes page, student dashboard, payment(student dashboard), My Selected Classes(student dashboard), My Enrolled Classes(student dashboard), Instructor Dashboard, Add a Class (Instructor Dashboard), My classes(Instructor Dashboard), My Classes(Instructor Dashboard),   Admin Dashboard, Manage Classes(Admin dashboard), Manage Users(Admin Dashboard) . In this webpage user can: 
* This website will show 6 popular classes and the popular teachers depending on the number of the student on the Home page .  
* In the Instructor page user can see all the users . 
* In Classes page user need to login first and the user need to be student . Otherwise they can see the class bu the button will be disabled if the user is not a student.
* To go to the Dashboard user need to login first. Different Users has different Dashboard. 
* Student can see the selected class and give payment for individual class.  
* Instructor can see his classes if the denied section buttonis red then the class for that instructor is cacelled by the Admin. Instructor can also create a class.
